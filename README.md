# AI-Powered Healthcare Assistant

This project is an AI-powered healthcare assistant designed to analyze *patient-submitted images and audio recordings* describing their symptoms and provide a *natural, doctor-like response*. It aims to support patients with general insights, condition identification, and symptom relief suggestions â€” all while emphasizing the need for professional medical advice.

## Features

- Accepts both *image* and *audio* inputs from the user.
- Uses AI to:
  - Identify likely diseases or conditions.
  - Recommend general treatments and precautions.
  - Suggest home remedies and OTC medications (non-prescriptive).
- Generates a *single, clear, and natural paragraph* response.
- Includes a *confidence score* to indicate reliability.
- Clearly states the response is *AI-generated and not a substitute for professional diagnosis*.

## Response Structure

Each AI-generated response will include:
1. Identification of the likely disease or condition.
2. A conversational statement about the suspected diagnosis.
3. General treatment suggestions (excluding specific dosages).
4. Important precautions and lifestyle adjustments.
5. Safe, general home remedies or OTC symptom relief suggestions.
6. A friendly, informative tone as if from a healthcare professional.
7. A disclaimer about the AI-generated nature of the response.
8. A *confidence level* (e.g., High, Moderate, Low).

## Example Response

"Based on the image of your skin and the symptoms you've described in the audio, it appears you might be experiencing a mild case of contact dermatitis. This condition usually occurs when your skin reacts to something it touches, like soaps, detergents, or plants. Typically, it's treated with soothing creams, avoiding the irritant, and keeping the area moisturized. You should avoid scratching or applying any harsh substances. For relief, you might try an over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream or an oral antihistamine, but be sure to follow the packaging instructions. This response is AI-generated and meant for informational purposes only. It's always best to consult a qualified doctor for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment. Confidence Level: Moderate."

## Technologies Used

- Python (depending on implementation)
